Method

Slice the onions, chop the tomatoes, slit the green chillies, chop mint and coriander leaves (with its stalk), and keep it aside.

Grind garlic to paste with its skin and peel ginger and grind to a paste,  pastes should be thick

I have taken only chicken leg pieces; you can take the whole chicken pieces also. Make a slit on the chicken pieces so that the masala of biryani while cooking goes well.

Wash the rice, soak for 1/2hr and drain and keep it aside.
For the curry

Heat the big wider vessel, add oil as per your requirement, when hot, add all the whole spices bay leaf, green cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick, mace and nutmeg, let it splutter.

Add sliced onions, sauté till onions are golden and transparent.

Add garlic paste sauté for 3minutes till it is light golden colour.
Add ginger paste roast for 2 min and then add the chicken pieces mix well with onion mixture and cook until the chicken is lightly suated , it will take 4 to 5minutes.

Add chopped tomatoes and sauté for 3min, add chilli powder, turmeric powder, mix well and cook for 5 minutes, until tomatoes becomes soft and starts leaving oil.

Add half the mint leaves and all coriander leaves, sauté for 2mintues, and then add curd and green chillies and water ½ cup, cook for 20minutes by closing the lid, until chicken is cooked well and forms like gravy consistency and leaves oil. In between stir the chicken curry.

Simmer the flame, add remaining mint leaves again or a handful and cook for 10 to 15min minutes again by closing the lid, in meanwhile cook the rice and keep it ready or switch of the curry to cook the rice.

Take a wider vessel add water and salt as required, with few mint leaves and a pinch colour, when the water starts boiling add the basmati rice and let it cook half done, it will take 5 minutes approximately.

Switch off and strain all the water through colander and keep it aside.
Mixing gravy and rice (layering)

When the chicken curry (chicken is heated up nicely) is ready, add the rice, which is 50% to 60% cooked, mix it entirely with the chicken curry (gravy), check the salt content in both.

Drizzle lemon juice and ghee or oil on top of the rice, spread evenly.

 Dum process

Check for the little steam escaping from the sides. Alternatively just keep your hand near the rice to check whether it is getting hot or not.

If you are able to see some steam, from that point onwards quickly close the lid with aluminium foil or keep some heavy weight on the lid or close it with a cloth and then the lid.

 Simmer for 20 to 25minutes, switch off.

The sign of whether the biryani is cooked and ready is when you can smell its aroma from the nearby rooms.

Switch off and let it rest for 15 mins. Do not open the lid immediately because the steam inside the vessel will continue to cook the biryani and prevent the steam from escaping.

When the biryani is cooked, you need to be careful while serving. Take the biryani out with a wide spoon or a saucer slowly from one side to prevent the rice grains from breaking.

Serve this bai biryani with raita and kathrika pachidi (ennai kathrika) also known as Brinjal ki chutney or Baigan chutney.
